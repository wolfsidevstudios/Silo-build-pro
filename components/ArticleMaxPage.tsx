            Max is no longer just a prompter; it's a strategic partner. With an upgraded thought process, proactive debugging, and a smoother workflow, Max 1.5 represents a major leap in AI-human collaboration.

          <p>
            When we first introduced Max, our vision was to create an AI partner that could help automate the creative process. Max could suggest ideas and kickstart your build with a single click. Today, with the launch of Silo Build 1.5, we're evolving Max from a helpful assistant into a true autonomous teammate.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black pt-8 pb-2">A More Intelligent Thought Process</h2>
          <p>
            The core of the Max 1.5 upgrade is its new brain. Powered by a more advanced reasoning model with Gemini, Max no longer just guesses the next feature. It now analyzes the entire context of your project—your existing code, your conversation history, and, most importantly, any runtime errors—to make strategic decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Max's new decision-making framework is simple yet powerful:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 pl-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Observe:</strong> Max starts by reviewing the current state of the application. Are there any errors? What was the last feature added? What was the original goal?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Orient:</strong> Based on its observations, Max decides on the most critical priority. An unhandled error takes precedence over adding a new feature. A half-finished component needs completion before starting something new.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Act:</strong> Max formulates a concise, actionable prompt designed to address the top priority and hands it off to the core developer AI to execute the build.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can follow this entire process in the new, more detailed Max Agent Panel, which now shows not only Max's thoughts but also the specific actions it's taking.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black pt-8 pb-2">Proactive Debugging: Your AI Bug Squasher</h2>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most exciting new capability is proactive debugging. If your application throws an error, Max 1.5 will see it. Instead of waiting for you to intervene, its next action will automatically be to attempt a fix. It will analyze the error message in the context of your code and generate a targeted prompt for the developer AI, such as:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 my-8 pl-4 py-4 italic text-gray-600 bg-gray-100 rounded-r-lg">
            "The app crashed with 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined'. It seems the user state is not initialized properly in `src/App.tsx`. Please add a `useState` hook to initialize the user state as an empty object."
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This turns Max into a vigilant teammate that helps keep your project on track, reducing frustrating debugging cycles and accelerating your progress.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-black pt-8 pb-2">Smoother Than Ever</h2>
          <p>
            An intelligent agent should feel intelligent. We've completely rebuilt Max's on-screen presence to be more fluid and lifelike. The cursor now moves with graceful easing, and its actions are more clearly communicated in the UI. It's a small touch, but it makes the experience of collaborating with Max feel less like watching a script and more like true pair programming.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Max 1.5 is more than an update; it's the next step in the future of software development—a future where human creativity is amplified by intelligent, autonomous AI partners.
